As described in [An engineer's path to learning JS](./engineers-path-to-js), I've learned how to code during various projects. Once I got involved in more complex web applications, like the [HICSS CMS](../projects/hicss-cms), I've noticed that I actually enjoy software development more than engineering, and that I wanted to shift my career focus more and more towards software engineering. I've successfully done so over the last few years, see [see projects](../projects), and am enjoying the exposure to various areas of CS in the graduate program. 

Personally, I hope to go more in-depth this semester on Javascript and software engineering principles. In particular, I hope to learn more about Javascript build tools, like Webpack, and state management in React. Otherwise, it'll be fun to just advance my skills through WODs and a fun class project.
