As described in [An engineer's path to learning JS](https://hsmidt.github.io/essays/engineers-path-to-js.html), I've learned how to code during various projects. Once I got involved in more complex web applications, like the [HICSS CMS](https://hsmidt.github.io/essays/hicss-cms.html), I've noticed that I enjoy software development actually more than engineering, and that I wanted to shift my career focus more and more towards software engineering. I've successfully done so over the last few years and am enjoying to get some exposure to various areas of CS in the graduate program. 

Personally, I hope just go more in-depth this semester on Javascript and software engineering principles. In particular, I hope to learn more about Javascript build tools, like Babel or Webpack, and state management in React. Otherwise, it'll be fun to just advance my skills thorugh WODs and a fun project.
